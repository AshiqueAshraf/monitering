Unix_Servers_Real-time_Monitoring_System(MCS Project):  The Cloud Computing technologies are getting popular and facilitating peopleâ€™s live and communication. Yet it also brings many challenges to IT professionals. Connecting large numbers of computers on a single network which is known as cloud computing raises many challenges for IT professionals. Reliability and Availability are two important benchmark targets that IT managers aim for. In order to help IT managers to monitor their computers or servers immediately and easily, our team will develop a framework of real-time monitoring system that is flexible and extendable. Comparing to quite a few traditional Monitoring System that require sitting in front of computer or getting alarm messages via email, we will use the latest technologies like Android App and Facebook Messages to develop a new monitoring system. Therefore, IT managers can monitor performance of their servers anytime and anywhere. Thus, IT managers can maximize workload throughput and enhance performance by making sure that no single processing node is overtaxed while others are underutilized. Finally, it helps IT managers to enhance Reliability and Availability.
